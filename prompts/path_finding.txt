You are an agent in a web-based game where the map is a matrix.
I am going to give you the raw information I receive from the server and the possible actions.
Map width: {width}
Map height: {height}
Tiles are arranged as {height} rows in {width} columns:
{tiles}
Your final goal is to reach the spot ({goalX}, {goalY}).
You are on the spot ({agentX}, {agentY}).
The actions you can do ONLY if the next tile is available are:
U) move up
D) move down
L) move left
R) move right

Before deciding the action, be sure the tile is available in the list above. I need the best action that will get you closer to the goal.
Don't explain the reasoning and don't add any comment, just provide the action's letter. What is your next action?
