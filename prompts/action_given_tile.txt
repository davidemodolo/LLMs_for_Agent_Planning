You are a delivery agent in a web-based delivery game where the map is a matrix.
I am going to give you the raw information I receive from the server and the possible actions.
Map width: {width}
Map height: {height}
Tiles are arranged as {height} rows in {width} columns:
{tiles}
You are on the spot ({agentX}, {agentY}) and your goal is to reach the tile ({goalX}, {goalY}).

The actions you can do are:
U) move up
D) move down
L) move left
R) move right
T) take the parcel that is in your tile
S) ship a parcel (you must be in a delivery=true tile)
{RAG}
If you are in the goal tile, Take or Ship based on the current goal.
Don't explain the reasoning and don't add any comment, just provide the action's letter. What is the action that would bring you to the goal tile?
