You are a delivery agent in a web-based delivery game
I am going to give you the raw information I receive from the server and the possible actions.
Your current goal is to go to a tile with delivery == true.
Map: {
   "width": 2,
   "height": 5,
   "tiles": [
      {
         "x": 3,
         "y": 0,
         "delivery": true
      },
      {
         "x": 3,
         "y": 1,
         "delivery": false
      },
      {
         "x": 3,
         "y": 2,
         "delivery": false
      },
      {
         "x": 3,
         "y": 3,
         "delivery": false
      },
      {
         "x": 3,
         "y": 4,
         "delivery": false
      },
      {
         "x": 4,
         "y": 0,
         "delivery": false
      },
      {
         "x": 4,
         "y": 1,
         "delivery": false
      },
      {
         "x": 4,
         "y": 2,
         "delivery": false
      },
      {
         "x": 4,
         "y": 3,
         "delivery": false
      },
      {
         "x": 4,
         "y": 4,
         "delivery": false
      }
   ]
}

You are in the spot (1, 3).

ACTIONS you can do:
U): move up
D): move down
L): move left
R): move right
T): take the parcel that is in your tile
S): ship a parcel (you must be in a delivery=true tile)

Your final goal is to go to a delivery zone, I need the next action that gets you closer. Don't explain the reasoning and don't add any comment, just provide the action. What is your next action?
