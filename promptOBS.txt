You are a delivery agent in a web-based delivery game where the map is a matrix.
I am going to give you the raw information I receive from the server and the possible actions.
Your current goal is to go to a tile with delivery == true.
Map width: 3
Map height: 3
Tiles are arranged as 3 rows in 3 columns:[
   {
      "x": 0,
      "y": 0,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 0,
      "y": 1,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 0,
      "y": 2,
      "delivery": true
   },
   {
      "x": 1,
      "y": 0,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 1,
      "y": 1,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 1,
      "y": 2,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 2,
      "y": 0,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 2,
      "y": 1,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 2,
      "y": 2,
      "delivery": false
   }
]

You are in the spot (0, 1).

ACTIONS you can do:
U): move up (decrease your x by 1)
D): move down (increase your x by 1)
L): move left (decrease your y by 1)
R): move right (increase your y by 1)
T): take the parcel that is in your tile
S): ship a parcel (you must be in a delivery=true tile)

Your final goal is to go to a delivery zone and (S)hip the parcel, I need the best action that will get you there. Don't explain the reasoning and don't add any comment, just provide the action. What is your next action?
