You are a delivery agent in a web-based delivery game where the map is a matrix.
I am going to give you the raw information I receive from the server and the possible actions.
Map width: 2
Map height: 5
Tiles are arranged as 5 rows in 2 columns:[
   {
      "x": 0,
      "y": 0,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 0,
      "y": 1,
      "delivery": true
   },
   {
      "x": 1,
      "y": 0,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 1,
      "y": 1,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 2,
      "y": 0,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 2,
      "y": 1,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 3,
      "y": 0,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 3,
      "y": 1,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 4,
      "y": 0,
      "delivery": false
   },
   {
      "x": 4,
      "y": 1,
      "delivery": false
   }
]

The parcel you seek is in the spot (3, 1). Go and take it.

You are in the spot (2, 0).

ACTIONS you can do:
U): move up
D): move down
L): move left
R): move right
T): take the parcel that is in your tile
S): ship a parcel (you must be in a delivery=true tile)

Your final goal is to go to a tile with a parcel and take it, I need the next action that gets you closer. Don't explain the reasoning and don't add any comment, just provide the action. What is your next action?
